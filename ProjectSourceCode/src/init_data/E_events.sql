<div class="description-header" data-aura-rendered-by="28:231;a">Join us most weekdays this winter and spring at Biscayne National Park to help preserve our beautiful park. With a preservation area of 95% water, we take ocean pollution as a serious issue, not just for our marine life, but for our community of South Florida as well. Accumulating debris on our beaches can hinder successful nesting by threatened and endangered sea turtles and cause entanglement hazards to many other animals. We need YOU to help us protect and conserve our local environment. Last year, volunteers removed over 30,000 pounds of marine debris from park beaches. When you realize that a majority of this debris is actually plastic, the volume of trash removed is staggering.</div>

<p>Participants should meet in the Breezeway of the Dante Fascell Visitor Center at 8am and will be escorted by park staff to a meeting room for a quick introduction and safety briefing. We will then travel by park boats across Biscayne Bay to a beach on the oceanside of an island to conduct a cleanup on a sea turtle nesting beach. After a lunch break around noon, we will weigh and transport bagged debris from the beach to the boats. We will return to park headquarters at ~2pm and unload the trash from the boats. Participants can expect to be done by 3pm. If weather is poor and we cannot go out on a boat, an alternate work site either bayside or on the mainland may be visited instead.</p>

<p><strong><u>WHAT TO WEAR:</u></strong></p>
<p>Volunteers should wear a bathing suit and clothes that can get wet and dirty.  We will be wading in ~waist deep water at points during the day. Lightweight and long sleeves/pants are best to provide protection from the sun and bugs.  Due to the rough terrain, dive booties, old sneakers, or any other durable  thick-soled, closed-toe footwear are required (no open-toe shoes are allowed). We can loan you dive booties for your use if you do not have proper footwear. A light jacket, hat and sunglasses are recommended.  </p>
<p><strong><u>WHAT TO BRING:</u></strong></p>
<p>Plenty of food and water to last you the day (work is strenuous).  Although not necessary, a towel may be useful. </p>
<p>If anyone is highly prone to sea sickness, they should bring appropriate medications for the short boat trip.</p>
<p><strong><u>WHAT WE WILL PROVIDE:</u></strong></p>
<p>Coolers for food and drink storage, a large water jug for re-filling your reusable beverage container, sunscreen, bug spray, hand sanitizer, life jackets, dive booties (for those that need them), and all work-related gear (such as protective gloves, trash bags etc.). NOTE: If anyone has allergies/sensitivities and requires a particular brand of sunscreen or bug spray, they should plan to bring their own.</p>

By the 1960s, it was a destination for LGBTQ youth, many of whom had run away from or been kicked out of their homes.

The remains of sugar plantations, stacked stone walls constructed to pen cattle, and rock carvings left by Indigenous Peoples can be found along the trail. These remnants tell the stories of generations of people who have lived on St. John.

The oldest and tallest trees on the island can be found in this valley, creating a canopy of shade for hikers and a habitat for a variety of wildlife.

Relations with Great Britain were on the rise following the centennial of the latter conflict, ushering in an era of good feelings across the English-speaking Atlantic. Many monuments were erected during this era of high flying patriotism, celebrating the heroic acts of Americans present and past. There was even room to remember, albeit it obliquely, the greatest villain of the Revolution, a man whose name is still well-remembered today as a synonym for treachery: Benedict Arnold. But what sort of person would choose to immortalize Arnold with the now-famous boot monument?</p>
<p>The personality behind the Arnold monument was a man almost as complicated as the disgraced one-time Patriot general: General John Watts de Peyster of Red Hook in Dutchess County, New York. In de Peyster’s life we see echoes of themes that have long been held to explain Arnold’s treachery: a larger-than-life ego, lack of adequate recognition in his life, family problems, and a historically-bad case of timing. Join Dutchess County Historian William P. Tatum III for a journey through the colorful life of General de Peyster to learn why this personality of the 19th century found a kindred spirit in an infamous persona of the 18th century.</p>','[]','Special Event','','true','','02020E6A-A444-A40D-B1556172E9646538','false','2024-03-27','sara','','[{"timestart":"06:30 PM","timeend":"07:30 PM","sunsetend":"false","sunrisestart":"false"}]','Reservations are required.

<p>From March 20-27, 1954, William O. Douglas and 57 others hiked down the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal towpath in an effort to draw attention to the natural beauty and wonders of the ecosystems and history of the canal.  This hike was in response to an editorial article in the <em>Washington Post,</em> endorsing the idea of paving a parkway near the canal.  In honor of the 70<sup>th</sup> anniversary of this hike, our theme in the Discovery Space for March is The Hike and Saving Important Places!  Come learn about people who have spoken up to help preserve places which are now national parks around the country.  Share the parks and special places which are important to you with other visitors through activities.  Explore the concepts of preservation and conservation and how these ideas are used in parks.</p>
<p>Come visit the discovery room at the Great Falls Tavern during the month of March to participate in the activities.

Influenced as a youth by the Civil Rights Movements of the 70’s and 80’s in which social perception and status was based on the color of one’s skin or the place one calls home, Humes early expressions found a voice championing the plight of the homeless, urban conditions and stereotypes predicated on socio political, educational, economic prejudices and bigotry.</p>

He also contributed to advancing the technical aspects of bringing this artistry to light. In this class, you will learn some of Ansel’s important innovations to photography and how they relate to your modern digital camera.</p>
<p>This class is designed to instill more confidence in digital image capture, including understanding the histogram and fixing exposure problems. The foundations of the camera are also discussed: Aperture, shutter speed, and ISO; their light gathering and/or creative values. Our goal is to improve your technical camera proficiency while learning how important historical elements of Ansel’s photographic career are still relevant in modern digital photography.</p>
<p>Travel to a series of stunning locations where Ansel Adams composed some of his most famous photographs. Each stop in the Footsteps of Ansel Adams offers you the opportunity to see the very same scene through your own camera lens, as you are guided in-depth by an expert staff photographer to best capture the iconic vistas.</p>
<p>In this class you will dive into the philosophies and life stories of the man behind the legend. You’ll get to practice Ansel’s photographic techniques, and learn how he pushed the popularity of landscape photography while helping to motivate the American environmental movement.

<p>Americans have demonstrated boundless ingenuity in making their voices heard over the centuries. Whether it’s Bostonians dumping taxed tea into the harbor in the 1773, or 19th century bike activists delivering a 150,000-signature petition on a rack designed to look like a giant bicycle, or K-pop stans pre-registering at presidential rallies to make the events look empty in the 21st century, protest in America is constantly evolving in surprising and creative ways.</p>
<p>Revolutionary Spaces invites all storytellers and historians—from the amateur to the academic—to partake in Creative Acts of Protest: A History Slam! Come take the stage at Old South Meeting House to wow the crowd with your five-minute, 10-slide (or less) talk on a creative example of activism in American history. Apply for a slot in the evening’s lineup by emailing your idea to <a href="mailto:historyslam@revolutionaryspaces.org">historyslam@revolutionaryspaces.org</a>. Selected presenters will receive a $100 honorarium and the best Slammers of the night will win some great prizes that we have up our sleeves.</p>
<p>Not up for presenting? No worries! Come as early as 6:00 pm for beer, soda, and excellent snacks. Then kick back and enjoy the show, which starts at 6:30 pm.</p>

<h4 class="">March 28, 2024 - Featuring Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve</h4>
<p class="">Nearly 5,000 miles separate the Blackstone Valley from the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve in Alaska.</p>
<p lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">On one side of the continent, many people experience some of the worst light pollution on the planet. Far away in Alaska, people come from all over the world to see the northern lights during dark and long evenings.</p>
<p>While the Blackstone River Valley is best known for the ways that people have manipulated the landscape for industry, the waterways in Gates of the Arctic have seen far less interference from human beings. During this talk, rangers will discuss the differences between these landscapes, with a focus an under-appreciated resource: the night sky.</p>
<h4>April 4, 2024 - Featuring Thomas Edison National Historical Park</h4>
<p lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Inspiration can strike any time—and anywhere. Discover how national parks share stories about creativity, hard work, and innovation across the United States.</p>
<p lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">In the 1700s, blacksmiths and carpenters in the Blackstone River Valley created the parts and machines that launched the Industrial Revolution in America.</p>
<p lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">A century later, in West Orange, New Jersey, Thomas Edison continued this legacy of invention in his home and laboratory. This talk will explore some of the lesser-known figures in the history of technology as well as the famous Wizard of Menlo Park.</p>
<h4>April 11, 2024 - Featuring Saugus Ironworks National Historic Site</h4>
<p>Have you ever been told to strike while the iron is hot?</p>
<p>The building blocks for America’s age of industry were made in workshops and forges along powerful waterways. During this talk, rangers will discuss the development of Saugus Iron Works, the first sustained, integrated iron works in British Colonial America, and the development of Slater Mill, the first successful cotton spinning mill operation in the United States. Learn about the social and economic connections between these two sites and how to best plan your visit for spring or summer.</p>','[{"path":"/common/uploads/event_calendar/F2D0D365-CE4A-9CEC-48B84A63A36E1CF6.jpg","credit":"NPS/Pearson","imageId":"41547","altText":"Graphic of a computer sitting on a desk with text Parked at Home on the screen","title":"","ordinal":"0","caption":"Parked at Home graphic","url":"/common/uploads/event_calendar/F2D0D365-CE4A-9CEC-48B84A63A36E1CF6.jpg"}]','Special Event','','true','','F2DF7286-F35E-DE01-48C1954158217EC9','false','2024-03-28','blrv','https://www.nps.gov/blrv/planyourvisit/parked-at-home-series.htm','[{"timestart":"07:00 PM","timeend":"08:00 PM","sunsetend":"false","sunrisestart":"false"}]','','','0','0','Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park','2024-03-28','2024-03-28','park','','','["2024-03-28"]','','Parked at Home: Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve','','','["virtual","virtual program","Virtual Visit","Ranger Talk","Ranger","Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park","Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor","Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve","partnerships"]'),

<p>Athens, Georgia native turned New Orleans Folk Rock Diva, <strong>Lilli Lewis</strong> is a powerhouse composer and performing artist. Lewis uses her voice to bring what she calls sacred songs into profane spaces, and though she’s abandoned trying to define her sound, she hopes her audiences leave shows knowing two things: that they are brilliant as they are, and that they have the ability to use that brilliance to make a better world. Trained as an opera singer and classical pianist, Lewis has been a composer, producer and performer for over two decades. After carving out space as an African American queer woman of size, Lewis’ career has culminated in her album Americana being a top pick everywhere from NPR’s <em>All Songs Considered</em> to <em>Rolling Stone</em>. The FolkRockDiva is a musical polyglot who glides easily between folk, roots, country soul, gospel, and jazz, and has integrated New Orleans traditions by singing lead for Dirty Dozen Brass Band founding member Kirk Joseph’s Backyard Groove.</p>','[]','Regular Event','','true','','A02276AA-A9AE-2C76-03ADF81EFC4350FF','false','2024-03-28','jazz','','[{"timestart":"02:00 PM","timeend":"03:00 PM","sunsetend":"false","sunrisestart":"false"}]','Reservations are not required, but seating is limited and offered first come, first serve.','2:00 to 3:00 pm Central Time','0','0','New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park','2024-03-28','2024-03-28','park','Free and open to the public','','["2024-03-28"]','','Piano Hour at the New Orleans Jazz Museum','29.961255','','["new orleans jazz national historical park","New Orleans Jazz","New Orleans","Jazz","live music","Concert Series","Piano"]'),

<p lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">In the 1700s, blacksmiths and carpenters in the Blackstone River Valley created the parts and machines that launched the Industrial Revolution in America.</p>
<p lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">A century later, in West Orange, New Jersey, Thomas Edison continued this legacy of invention in his home and laboratory. This talk will explore some of the lesser-known figures in the history of technology as well as the famous Wizard of Menlo Park.</p>
<h4>April 11, 2024 - Featuring Saugus Ironworks National Historic Site</h4>
<p>Have you ever been told to strike while the iron is hot?</p>
<p>The building blocks for America’s age of industry were made in workshops and forges along powerful waterways. During this talk, rangers will discuss the development of Saugus Iron Works, the first sustained, integrated iron works in British Colonial America, and the development of Slater Mill, the first successful cotton spinning mill operation in the United States. Learn about the social and economic connections between these two sites and how to best plan your visit for spring or summer.</p>','[{"path":"/common/uploads/event_calendar/F2F1BE16-BE6C-9887-14817F649E17CD6E.jpg","credit":"NPS/Pearson","imageId":"41549","altText":"Graphic of a computer screen sitting on a desk with Parked at Home text on the screen","title":"","ordinal":"0","caption":"Parked at Home Graphic","url":"/common/uploads/event_calendar/F2F1BE16-BE6C-9887-14817F649E17CD6E.jpg"}]','Special Event','','true','','F2FD47E3-A02E-AC52-003EC65C39A6896F','false','2024-04-04','blrv','https://www.nps.gov/blrv/planyourvisit/parked-at-home-series.htm','[{"timestart":"07:00 PM","timeend":"08:00 PM","sunsetend":"false","sunrisestart":"false"}]','','','0','0','Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park','2024-04-04','2024-04-04','park','','','["2024-04-04"]','','Parked at Home: Thomas Edison National Historical Park','','','["virtual","virtual program","Virtual Visit","ranger program","Ranger Talk","Ranger","Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park","Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor","Thomas Edison National Historical Park","partnerships"]'),

<p>Join us for an afternoon reception for our artist in residence, <strong>Monica Rose Kelly</strong>. The afternoon will also include a jazz concert featuring <strong>Victor Campbell’s Latin Gumbo</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Monica Rose Kelly</strong> has been running her studio in New Orleans for over a decade. Her practice intersects the fields of fine art, public art, murals, illustration, and design. Monica’s work is vibrant in nature and communicates the energy of the soul. Her unique style was influenced by growing up around hip hop and graffiti, as well as traveling around the world and discovering the great works of the Impressionist painters, as well as the Art Nouveau and Art Deco architectural movements. <a href="https://monicakellystudio.com/">https://monicakellystudio.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>Victor Campbell</strong> is a young jazz piano player hailing from Camagüey, Cuba. His compelling style combines virtuosity, whimsy, charisma and technical prowess. He started playing piano at age five and went on to train at Cuba’s National School of the Arts. He has played across the US and internationally. Campbell first visited New Orleans in 2012 as part of an exchange program with the Louis Armstrong Summer Jazz Camp. That visit made a profound impact and in 2019 the young pianist decided to move to New Orleans. He has been feverishly studying every form of New Orleans music ever since and incorporating this wide range into his unique musical language. In a 2019 interview, legendary Cuban musician Chucho Valdés predicted that VicJcom will revolutionize Cuban jazz piano. -OFFBEAT</p>

The tufa exposures form the shape of the meandering streams accross the landscape, as they were 10,600 years ago.

<p><strong>The SF-88 Nike Missile Site </strong>is the most fully restored Nike missile site in the country. During the tense years of the Cold War, from 1953 to 1979, the United States Army built and operated close to 300 Nike missile sites in the United States. These sites were designed to be the last line of defense against H-Bomb carrying Soviet bombers that had eluded the Air Force’s interceptor jet aircrafts. SF-88 in the Marin Headlands was one such site. Today, Golden Gate National Recreation Area works together with a dedicated group of volunteers to preserve the site as it was during operations to remind visitors of the physical and psychological effects of the Cold War on the American landscape.</p>
<ul>
<li>The only restrooms available at Nike are Port-a-Johns. However, about a mile down the road before the Nike Missile Site is a larger rest-stop / parking lot with larger restooms and running water. It is recommended to stop and use these if needed, prior to arriving to Nike.</li>

<p>Battery Townsley, at Fort Cronkhite, was San Francisco''s most extensive—and most secret—World War II military fortification.<br /><br />From 1940 to 1948, it mounted two massive battleship guns and housed more than 100 soldiers in an extensive network of underground tunnels; during the Cold War, it was used as an underground research facility.<br /><br />Long closed to public access, Battery Townsley has been refurbished thanks to volunteer labor and community contributions and is now ready for tours. The public is invited to visit and explore this labyrinthine fortification!</p>
<p>In fall 2012, the park brought to this site a 16-inch gun, from the USS <em>Missouri</em>.

<p>This event features local NASA Ambassador Mark Benson, who will be on hand to answer questions and offer guidance on viewing the eclipse. “These are rare events, especially when you get totality or this close to it,” said Benson. “So many things have to be just right for a total solar eclipse.” </p>
<p>In the Chicago area, the eclipse begins at 12:51 p.m. on as the Moon moves between the Sun and the Earth. The height of the event will be at 2:08 p.m.</p>
<p>Visitors will have the opportunity to see the eclipse through a solar filter telescope, earn the Junior Ranger eclipse badge, enjoy eclipse themed snacks, snap a photo in a space-themed selfie station, and partake in hands on activities. </p>
<p>This event is free. Bring a lawn chair and approved solar viewing glasses (a limited number of glasses will be available). </p>
<p><em>It’s NEVER safe to look directly at the sun. Use special approved solar viewing glasses or create a pin-hole camera to cast a safe shadow to view a solar eclipse.

<h4>April 11, 2024 - Featuring Saugus Ironworks National Historic Site</h4>
<p>Have you ever been told to strike while the iron is hot?</p>
<p>The building blocks for America’s age of industry were made in workshops and forges along powerful waterways. During this talk, rangers will discuss the development of Saugus Iron Works, the first sustained, integrated iron works in British Colonial America, and the development of Slater Mill, the first successful cotton spinning mill operation in the United States. Learn about the social and economic connections between these two sites and how to best plan your visit for spring or summer.</p>','[{"path":"/common/uploads/event_calendar/F30C3450-BB6C-55A4-6B9D28E78B07D7A0.jpg","credit":"NPS/Pearson","imageId":"41550","altText":"Graphic of a computer screen sitting on a desk with text Parked at Home on the screen","title":"","ordinal":"0","caption":"Parked at Home Graphic","url":"/common/uploads/event_calendar/F30C3450-BB6C-55A4-6B9D28E78B07D7A0.jpg"}]','Special Event','','true','','F31D9325-A01F-631C-FDD11F4BE8BA6E4D','false','2024-04-11','blrv','https://www.nps.gov/blrv/planyourvisit/parked-at-home-series.htm','[{"timestart":"07:00 PM","timeend":"08:00 PM","sunsetend":"false","sunrisestart":"false"}]','','','0','0','Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park','2024-04-11','2024-04-11','park','','','["2024-04-11"]','','Parked at Home: Saugus Iron Work National Historic Site','','','["virtual","virtual program","Virtual Visit","ranger program","Ranger Talk","Ranger","Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park","Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor","Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site","partnerships"]'),

<p>The conspirators were part of a pro-Southern secret society that didn’t want an anti-slavery President in the White House. They planned an elaborate scheme to assassinate the brand new President in a Baltimore train station as Lincoln’s inauguration train passed through en route to the Capital. The plot was investigated by famed detective Allan Pinkerton, who infiltrated the group with undercover agents, including one of the first female private detectives in America. Had the assassination succeeded, there would have been no Lincoln Presidency, and the course of the Civil War and American history would have forever been altered.</p>

Please bring a flashlight or headlamp for the walk balk. Binoculars are very helpful but not required.</p>
<p>The American Woodcock are short-legged shorebirds with a long bill and large eyes. They are often called unique names such as mudsnipe, bogsucker, or timberdoodle. Woodcock perform amazing aerial displays for their spring courtship rituals. These elaborate sky dances occur at dusk in open fields and begin with the males making distinct peenting calls. Subsequently they launch into a flight as high as 300 feet, go into a deep dive, and land close to where they took off. It is a wondrous event to experience. We will also be listening for owls, wood frogs, spring peepers and other nighttime sounds.</p>','[]','Special Event','','false','','3732552B-FF39-250E-1845350F0C538195','false','2024-04-22','sara','','[{"timestart":"07:00 PM","timeend":"09:00 PM","sunsetend":"false","sunrisestart":"false"}]','','','0','0','Saratoga National Historical Park','2024-04-22','2024-04-22','park','','','["2024-04-22"]','','Evening Woodcock Walk','43.012212','','[]'),

<p>From the moment the Separatists and Puritans made contact with the Indigenous People of what is now known as Massachusetts, the Commonwealth has had a history steeped in revolution. With the establishment of Boston, Governor John Winthrop proclaimed it “a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people will be upon us.” While it is prized for its historic social and political impacts, Boston is still responsible for spearheading revolutionary change in modern times for the LGBTQ+ community, with the eyes of the country upon it.</p>
<p>In this online talk, historian and author Russ Lopez will discuss how a state that was formed on strong puritanical ideologies became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage. Discussing some of the lesser-known histories of Massachusetts’ past, Lopez shows us that there has always been an LGBTQ+ community in the Commonwealth, just not always in plain sight.</p>','[{"path":"/common/uploads/event_calendar/3A509D10-D419-2754-A31324B788430442.png","credit":"Old North Illuminated","imageId":"42043","altText":"Graphic of men in 17th centry clothing drinking","title":"","ordinal":"0","caption":"From Queer Puritans to Marriage Equality in the Commonwealth","url":"/common/uploads/event_calendar/3A509D10-D419-2754-A31324B788430442.png"}]','Special Event','','true','','3A580488-B3F4-9413-0D487F308B4FC698','false','2024-04-25','bost','https://www.oldnorth.com/events/','[{"timestart":"07:00 PM","timeend":"08:30 PM","sunsetend":"false","sunrisestart":"false"}]','Registration is required in advance to receive zoom link','','0','0','Boston National Historical Park','2024-04-25','2024-04-25','park','Donation is requested','','["2024-04-25"]','','From Queer Puritans to Marriage Equality in the Commonwealth','42.366321','','["Boston","Boston National Historical Park","Freedom Trail","Old North Church"]'),
